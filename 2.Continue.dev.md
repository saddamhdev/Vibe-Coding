Excellent question 👌 — this is important to understand clearly.

Short answer:

> ✅ Yes — you can get equivalent ChatGPT results in Continue.dev
> ⚠️ But only if configured properly.

Now let me explain properly.

---

# 🧠 1️⃣ Is Continue.dev the Same as ChatGPT?

Continue.dev is **just a client** (like a UI).

It does NOT have its own AI.

It sends requests to:

* OpenAI API (your key)
* Or other providers

So the intelligence comes from:

```
Model you select + Prompt quality + Context sent
```

---

# 🧾 2️⃣ Will It Be Exactly Same as ChatGPT Web?

Not 100% identical.

Why?

Because ChatGPT web:

* Uses hidden system prompts
* Has conversation memory
* Has additional safety layers
* Sometimes uses optimized routing

Continue.dev:

* Uses raw OpenAI API
* No automatic memory unless you configure
* Context is limited to what it sends

But quality of reasoning is the same if model is same.

---

# 🧠 3️⃣ Model Choice Matters (Very Important)

If you use:

```
gpt-4o
```

You will get very close to ChatGPT web quality.

If you use:

```
gpt-4o-mini
```

You will get cheaper but slightly weaker responses.

If you use:

```
o3
```

You will get stronger reasoning (better for architecture).

---

# 🎯 For Your Backend Work (ICSQuiz Style)

Use:

```yaml
defaultModel: openai/o3
```

For:

* Architecture review
* Performance optimization
* Complex microservice analysis

Use:

```yaml
gpt-4o-mini
```

For:

* Small refactors
* Boilerplate
* Quick code edits

---

# 🚀 4️⃣ How To Make Continue As Smart As ChatGPT

Add strong system prompt:

```yaml
systemMessage: |
  You are a senior Spring Boot microservices architect.
  Provide production-ready, optimized, and scalable solutions.
  Avoid beginner explanations.
```

Now it behaves closer to ChatGPT Pro tone.

---

# ⚠️ Where Continue Is Slightly Weaker

* Long multi-turn memory
* Large architectural brainstorming
* File-level context sometimes limited
* No automatic web browsing

But for coding inside IntelliJ?

👉 It is often MORE useful than ChatGPT web
Because it sees your actual project files.

---

# 💡 Real Advantage for You

ChatGPT Web:

* Good for ideas

Continue in IntelliJ:

* Good for actual code context
* Reads real files
* Knows imports
* Knows project structure

For serious backend work → IDE integration is better.

---

# 🔥 Honest Answer For You

Yes, you will get equivalent intelligence
But ChatGPT web feels more polished conversationally.

For microservices development?
Continue is more practical.
