Yes ✅ — **an MCP server runs as a separate process** from Continue (and from your Spring Boot app, unless you embed it).

Think of it like this:

```
Continue (IDE)
      ↓
MCP Server (separate service)
      ↓
PostgreSQL / APIs / Tools
```

---

# 🔥 Why It Runs Separately

Because:

* Continue launches it as a subprocess **or**
* Connects to it over HTTP
* It must stay alive to receive tool calls
* It exposes tools via a protocol (JSON-RPC / MCP schema)

If it exits → you get:

```
MCP error -32000: Connection closed
```

---

# 🏗 Two Common Ways to Run MCP

## 1️⃣ Subprocess Mode (Local Command)

Continue starts it:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: postgres-mcp
    command: node
    args:
      - /absolute/path/server.js
```

Here:

* Continue launches Node
* Keeps process open
* Talks via stdio

This is simple but local-only.

## 2️⃣ HTTP Mode (Cleaner Architecture)

You run server yourself:

```bash
node server.js
```

Or:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Then Continue connects:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: postgres-mcp
    transport:
      type: http
      url: http://localhost:3001/mcp
```

This is better for:

✔ Production
✔ Docker
✔ Microservices
✔ Kubernetes

# 🧠 In Your Case (Swosti Project)

Since you already have:

* Spring Boot
* PostgreSQL
* Service layer
* Banking modules

Best architecture:

👉 Add `/mcp` controller in Spring Boot
👉 Run Spring Boot normally
👉 Continue connects via HTTP

No separate Node server needed.

# 🏦 Architect-Level Setup (Recommended for You)

```
Swosti (Spring Boot)
  ├── /api/*
  ├── /mcp  ← MCP endpoint
  └── PostgreSQL
```

Then Continue:

```yaml
mcpServers:
  - name: swosti-mcp
    transport:
      type: http
      url: http://localhost:8080/mcp
```

Now AI can:

* Query ledger
* Analyze transactions
* Inspect tables
* Generate reports

---

# ⚠ Important

MCP server must:

* Stay running
* Not exit immediately
* Return structured JSON
* Handle tool calls properly

If it crashes → connection closed error.

---

# 🎯 Final Answer

Yes — MCP server runs separately.

But:

* It can be a standalone Node app
* Or embedded inside your Spring Boot service
* Or even Dockerized

If you want, I’ll now:

* Show you how to embed MCP cleanly inside your Swosti banking project
* Or design a production-ready AI + PostgreSQL + MCP architecture for you 🚀
