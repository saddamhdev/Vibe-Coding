Great 👍
Now I’ll give you a **clear integration guide** — no confusion, no marketing — just practical ways to integrate an AI agent into IntelliJ.

There are **3 real integration levels**:

---

# 🥇 LEVEL 1 — Use AI Plugin (Easiest & Recommended)

This is what 95% of developers do.

## ✅ Option A: Continue.dev (Uses Your OpenAI API)

### Step 1 — Install Plugin

```
IntelliJ → Settings → Plugins → Marketplace
Search: Continue
Install → Restart
```

### Step 2 — Configure `config.yaml`

Open Continue panel → Open config file → Paste:

```yaml
name: Local Config
version: 1.0.0
schema: v1

defaultModel: openai/gpt-4o

models:
  - uses: openai/gpt-4o
    with:
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      systemMessage: |
        You are a senior Spring Boot microservices architect.
        Optimize for performance, scalability, and clean architecture.
```

### Step 3 — Set Environment Variable

PowerShell:

```powershell
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_new_key_here"
```

Restart IntelliJ.

---

✅ Now AI works inside editor.

You can:

* Highlight code → Ask AI
* Generate tests
* Refactor services
* Analyze YAML
* Review JPA queries

---

# 🥈 LEVEL 2 — Use Official JetBrains AI Assistant

If you don’t want custom config:

```
Settings → Plugins → JetBrains AI Assistant
```

This uses JetBrains cloud backend (paid plan required).

Simpler but less customizable.

# 🥉 LEVEL 3 — Build Your Own AI Agent Inside IntelliJ (Advanced)

Since you’re backend-focused, this is interesting.

You can build a small tool using:

### IntelliJ Plugin SDK

Create your own plugin that:

* Reads selected code
* Sends to OpenAI API
* Shows response in tool window

### Or Build Local AI Gateway

Create Spring Boot service:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/ai")
public class AiController {

    @PostMapping("/review")
    public String review(@RequestBody String code) {
        return openAiService.ask("Review this code:\n" + code);
    }
}
```

Then call it from IntelliJ HTTP client.

Now you have your own internal AI reviewer.
