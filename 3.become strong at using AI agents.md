Excellent question, Saddam 👌🔥
Now you’re thinking like an **AI-powered engineer**, not just a user.

If you want to become **strong at using AI agents (especially for coding + backend + microservices)**, here’s what you should learn.

I’ll structure this properly for your level.

---

# 🧠 1️⃣ Prompt Engineering (Must Learn)

This is the #1 skill.

### What to Learn:

* Clear task framing
* Role-based prompting
* Constraint-based prompting
* Iterative refinement
* Output format control (JSON, YAML, code blocks)

### Example (Bad vs Good)

❌ Bad:

```
Improve this code
```

✅ Better:

```
Refactor this Spring Boot service to:
- Reduce DB calls
- Improve thread safety
- Follow clean architecture
- Add proper exception handling
```

# 🧩 2️⃣ Context Management (Very Important in IDE AI)

AI is only as smart as the context you give it.

Learn:

* How to give relevant file parts
* How to summarize large classes before asking
* How to split problems into steps

For microservices like ICSQuiz:

* Send controller + service together
* Send entity + repository together
* Send gateway filter + config together

---

# ⚙️ 3️⃣ System Prompt Design (Advanced)

Instead of repeating instructions every time, define personality.

Learn:

* How system prompts shape responses
* How to create different modes:

  * Strict reviewer
  * Architecture advisor
  * Performance auditor
  * Security reviewer

Example mindset:

> “AI is a junior engineer. You are the architect controlling it.”

---

# 🏗 4️⃣ Architecture-Level Thinking

AI becomes powerful when you know what to ask.

Since you work with:

* Spring Boot
* Gateway
* RabbitMQ
* Redis
* Kubernetes

You should deeply understand:

* Clean Architecture
* Event-driven design
* CQRS
* Caching strategies
* Database indexing
* Async processing

AI amplifies your knowledge — it does not replace it.

---

# 🔍 5️⃣ Code Review Skills

Use AI as a reviewer.

Learn:

* How to ask AI to find edge cases
* How to detect N+1 query
* How to detect memory leaks
* How to review concurrency issues

Example:

```
Act as a strict code reviewer and find production risks in this class.
```

---

# 📊 6️⃣ Cost & Token Awareness (Professional Level)

If you’re using API:

Learn:

* Token usage
* Model differences
* When to use small vs big model
* Batch vs interactive usage

For example:

* Use `gpt-4o-mini` for boilerplate
* Use `o3` for architecture reasoning

---

# 🤖 7️⃣ Automation with AI (Next Level)

You can go further and learn:

* How to build AI-based Git commit reviewer
* AI-powered log analyzer
* AI code audit pipeline
* AI documentation generator
* AI architecture diagram generator

Since you’re backend-focused, this will give you an edge.

---

# 🧠 8️⃣ Agent Thinking (Very Advanced)

This is where most developers don’t go.

Learn:

* How to break tasks into subtasks
* How AI chains tasks
* Tool usage patterns
* Multi-step reasoning
* Self-reflection prompting

Example:

Instead of asking:

```
Build quiz system
```

Ask stepwise:

1. Design DB schema
2. Optimize for 100k users
3. Add caching
4. Add async scoring
5. Add monitoring

That’s agent thinking.

# 🎯 What YOU Should Focus On

Based on your profile (microservices + DevOps + performance focus):

Prioritize:

1️⃣ Prompt engineering
2️⃣ Architecture-level questioning
3️⃣ AI-based code review workflow
4️⃣ Performance auditing with AI
5️⃣ Automation scripting with AI

---
